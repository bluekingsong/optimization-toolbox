  This project implements and compares some optimization algorithms, such as L-BFGS, sample L-BFGS, CG-Newton, sample CG-Newton etc.

 The results verify the performances of sub-sampled Hessian algorithms in "On the Use of Stochastic Hessian Information in Optimization
Methods for Machine Learning".
